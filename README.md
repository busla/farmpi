# FarmPi

A weekend gardening project I designed for a small greenhouse in Reykjalundur, Iceland, farmed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nick.robinson.1829405?fref=ts">Nick Robinson</a>. Growing squash in Iceland seems to be tough so he wanted constant temperature measurement in soil and air.

The sensors used are <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/381">ds18b20</a>.

See <a href="http://farmpi.nonni.cc">DEMO</a> (note: the demo is generating random numbers since weÂ´re using the Pi in the greenhouse :-)
